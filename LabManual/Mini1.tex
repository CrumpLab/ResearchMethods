\section{Lab 4: MiniProject 1 Nairne, Pandeirada, \& Thompson, (2008)}

In the first mini-project, you will read, summarize and discuss the paper by \citeauthor{nairne_adaptive_2008} (2008)\cite{nairne_adaptive_2008}. Then, you will attempt to replicate their results in the lab, by conducting an experiment and analyzing the data.

\subsection{What's in store}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Students read paper and write QALMRI (15-20)
\item Group discussion about paper (15-20)
\item	Students attempt to replicate the major findings in the paper

a.	Break into four-five groups, each group assigned an encoding condition (Survival, Pleasantness, Imagery, Self-reference, Intentional learning)

b.	Each group picks their own 30 words. Can follow same procedure as in paper by choosing 30 words from Overschelde, Rawson, \& Dunlosky (2004) \cite{van_overschelde_category_2004}.

c.	Groups try to run at least 10 participants in their condition, recording proportion of correctly recalled words

d.	Groups enter their collected data into the master spreadsheet, which is given back to groups upon data completion

\item Discussion of how to analyze the data
\item Group attempt to analyze the data using t-tests and one-way ANOVA to determine if the survival framing produced better recall than the other conditions.
\end{enumerate}
